    <h1>Creating a United and
        Fairer Wales for All</h1>

    <p>In recovering from the pandemic, we want to ensure everyone shares
        in the opportunities of the future, wherever they live, so no one is held
        back or left behind.

    <p>We are opposed to the short-sighted and cruel decision by the Conservative UK Government to cut the
        Â£20 Universal Credit uplift, which will drive more households into poverty as we face a cost-of-living crisis.
        We will do all we can to reduce inequalities and tackle poverty.</p>

    <p>We want to make Wales an anti-racist nation and drive out stigma and hatred. We want a Wales where
        everyone is respected and their diversity celebrated. Wales will continue to provide a warm welcome
        for all.</p>

    <p>Wales has a long and proud history and distinctive culture, built around our language, which thrives today.
        We will work to strengthen our language and culture, protecting it where needed, promoting it and helping
        make Welsh an everyday reality for all, as we work towards our shared goal of a million Welsh-speakers.</p>


    <h2>Working Together, We Will: </h2>

    <ul>

        <li><b>Culture Strategy</b> - Develop a new culture
            strategy, reflecting Wales' diversity, a thriving
            Welsh language, our arts, culture and heritage
            sectors and our duties under the Wellbeing
            of Future Generations Act. We will ensure
            the financial sustainability of national cultural
            institutions as we implement the strategy and
            we will also develop the proposals for a national
            contemporary art gallery</li>


        <li><b>Curriculum</b> - Improve the teaching of Welsh
            history, taking account of the <span lang="cy">Estyn</span> report. We
            are committed to Welsh history being mandatory
            in the new Curriculum for Wales. New curriculum
            resources will be developed to support Welsh
            history in all its complexity and diversity. National
            Network conversations will start in early 2022.</li>


        <li><b><span lang="cy">Prosiect</span> 2050</b> - Promote the daily use of the
            Welsh language in more places. We will lead by
            example, supporting more sponsored bodies,
            local authorities and the Welsh civil service to
            operate through the medium of Welsh.</li>

        <li><b>Welsh Language Education</b> - Introduce a
            Welsh Language Education Bill, which together
            with more immediate non-legislative work, will
            strengthen Welsh in Education Strategic Plans;
            set new ambitions and incentives to expand the
            proportion of the education workforce who can
            teach and work through the Welsh language;
            establish and implement a single continuum
            of Welsh language learning; enable existing
            schools to move into a higher Welsh language
            category and incentivise the increase of Welsh medium provision in all education settings. </li>

        <li><b>Welsh Language Standards</b> - Work with the
            Welsh Language Commissioner to reduce
            obstacles in setting Welsh Language Standards;
            streamline the process for implementing
            standards, without weakening their impact;
            implement standards on public transport;
            regulators in the health sector; newly
            established public bodies currently outside
            the standards regime and water companies;
            and begin work on implementing standards on
            housing associations, which will be completed
            in the <span lang="cy">Senedd</span> term. We are committed to the full
            implementation of the Welsh Language (Wales)
            Measure 2011 and will develop a list to prioritise
            the further rollout of standards under its
            schedules beyond the term of this agreement.</li>


        <li><b>Welsh Language Place Names</b> - Ensure Welsh
            language place names in the built and natural
            environments are safeguarded and promoted.</li>


        <li><b><span lang="cy">Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol</span> and National
                Centre for Learning Welsh</b> - Invest in <span lang="cy">Coleg Cymraeg Cenedlaethol</span> and the
            National Centre
            for Learning Welsh to increase the proportion
            of Welsh-medium apprenticeships and further
            education and provide free Welsh language
            learning for 16 to 25-year-olds.
        </li>

        <li><b><span lang="cy">Seren</span> Network</b> - Increase the ability for
            learners from disadvantaged backgrounds to
            take part in the <span lang="cy">Seren</span> Network. We will offer
            summer schools at each Welsh university for
            <span lang="cy">Seren</span> Foundation learners; expand the current
            partnerships with <span lang="cy">Aberystwyth</span> and Cardiff
            universities and set up new pilots in other Welsh
            institutions.
        </li>

        <li><b>Tackling Poverty and Inequality</b> - Support the
            devolution of the administration of welfare and
            explore the necessary infrastructure required
            to prepare for it. Such a transfer of power would
            need to be accompanied by the transfer of
            appropriate financial support.</li>

        <li><b>Mental Health</b> - Test how community facilities
            run by trained third sector staff with clear
            referral pathways into NHS services if needed -
            the sanctuary model - can help support young
            people in crisis or with an urgent mental health
            or emotional wellbeing issue. These would be
            open evenings and weekends.
        </li>

        <li><b>Disability</b> - Strengthen the rights of disabled
            people and tackle the inequalities they continue
            to face. We are committed to the social model
            of disability and together we will ensure the
            success of the Disability Task Force set up to
            respond to the Locked Out report.</li>



        <li><b>Race Equality Action Plan</b> - Tackle
            institutionalised and systemic racism and
            support the publication of the <b>Race Equality
                Action Plan</b>. We will work with communities,
            stakeholders and partners, including the
            police and courts, to make the plan as strong
            as possible. We support efforts to ensure the
            devolution of policing and justice powers.</li>

        <li><b>LGBTQ+</b> - Make Wales the most LGBTQ+
            friendly nation in Europe and support the
            publication of the LGBTQ+ Action Plan. We will
            call for the powers to legislate to improve the
            lives and protect the safety of Trans people in
            Wales to be devolved</li>
