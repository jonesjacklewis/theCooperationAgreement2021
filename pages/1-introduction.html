        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>Almost a quarter of a century ago, people in Wales voted for self-government for Wales, with a promise of a
            new
            type of politics.</p>

        <p>They placed their trust in a new democracy with an instruction to work differently - inclusively and
            co-operatively. </p>

        <p>Today, as the Welsh Government and <span lang="cy">Plaid Cymru</span> come together in this
            Co-operation Agreement, we take another step forward in our collective
            effort to fulfil that promise of a new politics - radical in content and
            co-operative in approach.
        </p>

        <p>At the start of the Sixth <span lang="cy">Senedd</span>, Wales faces great opportunities but also
            many challenges.</p>

        <p>We are continuing to respond to an once-in-a-lifetime global pandemic,
            which has claimed the lives of millions of people worldwide and affected
            every aspect of our daily lives.</p>

        <p>The climate and nature emergencies together pose a far greater and lasting
            threat to our country and our way of life than the coronavirus pandemic if
            we do not take action now to address its worst affects. We have ambitious
            plans to create a low carbon Wales and move towards net zero - but these
            plans will need all of us and our public services to make choices and
            changes.</p>

        <p>The UK has now left the European Union but we are still dealing with
            the aftermath of this decision and we are faced daily with the actions
            of a Conservative UK Government determined to consolidate power in
            Westminster and turn back the clock on devolution.</p>

        <p>At the start of this <span lang="cy">Senedd</span> term, it is more important than ever that we have
            a strong Welsh Parliament able to work together and respond effectively to
            these challenges and make real and lasting change for people in Wales.</p>


        <p>This Co-operation Agreement is a response to these external challenges
            and that need for a stable <span lang="cy">Senedd</span>, capable of delivering radical change
            and reform.</p>


        <p>The commitments outlined in this agreement build on a number of shared
            values - social solidarity, a sustainable planet and a vibrant democracy. </p>

        <p>The Welsh Government and <span lang="cy">Plaid Cymru</span> will work together over the coming
            three years on the defined policy commitments listed in this document
            - policies in which we have common interests to implement progressive
            solutions - from ensuring no child goes hungry to ending homelessness.
            From working together to explore the long-term future of social care to
            meeting our shared commitment of a million Welsh speakers by 2050. </p>


        <p>Together, we will use this opportunity to address issues which take the
            greatest political and policy effort to resolve and, together, we will create
            progressive, made-in-Wales solutions.</p>

        <p>Where agreement is possible, people rightly expect political parties to work
            together. We look forward to making a real and lasting difference for people
            in Wales.</p>

        <p>It is said that those who lead should be a bridge - our hope is that this
            partnership will help forge the bridge we continue to build together as
            a nation.</p>
