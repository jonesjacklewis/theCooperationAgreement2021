        <h1>Reforming the Foundations of Wales</h1>

        <p>With devolution under threat from this Conservative UK Government,
            we must send a clear message to Westminster that the <span lang="cy">Senedd</span> is here
            to stay and decisions about Wales are made in Wales.</p>

    <main>
        <p>This means reforming our electoral system to enable Wales' parliamentarians to represent people more
            effectively and seriously considering all options for the future of our constitution.</p>

        <p>We will continue the reform of our education system to support all learners' physical and mental wellbeing
            and their academic progression, especially disadvantaged children; work to strengthen the media in
            Wales to address the democratic deficit and protect it from UK Government attacks on its independence,
            and we will continue to work with and support local government.</p>

        <h2>Working Together, We Will: </h2>

        <ul>


            <li><b><span lang="cy">Senedd</span> Reform</b> - Support plans to reform the
                <span lang="cy">Senedd</span>, based on 80 to 100 Members; a voting
                system, which is as proportional - or more -
                than the current one and have gender quotas
                in law. We will support the work of the <span lang="cy">Senedd</span>
                Special Purpose Committee and introduce
                a <span lang="cy">Senedd</span> reform Bill 12 to 18 months after it
                reports.
            </li>

            <li><b>Constitutional Commission</b> - Support the
                work of the Independent Commission on
                Wales' Constitutional Future. Both parties are
                free to make submissions and interact with the
                commission independently. The commission's
                interim and final reports will be presented jointly
                to both parties.
            </li>

            <li><b>Broadcasting</b> - Explore the creation of a
                shadow Broadcasting and Communications
                Authority for Wales, to address our concerns
                about the current fragility in the media and
                attacks on its independence. This body
                would support the use of the Welsh language,
                particularly in digital and encourage media
                plurality. We believe broadcasting and
                communication powers should be devolved
                to Wales.</li>

            <li><b>Media Financial Support</b> - Fund existing and
                new enterprises to improve Welsh-based
                journalism to tackle the information deficit. </li>

            <li><b><span lang="cy">Arfor</span></b> - Address inequalities between poorer
                and richer parts of the country by building on the
                <span lang="cy">Arfor</span> pilot, which promoted entrepreneurship,
                business growth, community resilience and the
                Welsh language. We will create a second phase
                with local government and ask the OECD to
                look at and design models for local government
                to work together in West Wales and the South
                Wales Valleys to tackle shared challenges and
                opportunities.
            </li>

            <li><b>National School of Government</b> - Explore how
                setting up a National School for Government
                might contribute to the principle of a One Wales
                Public Service. </li>

            <li><b>Regional Partnership Arrangements</b> - Keep regional partnership working under review,
                together with local government partners, to
                ensure they are efficient and work for Wales as
                new Corporate Joint Committee arrangements
                are introduced. Any changes should be locally
                led, driven by what works best and based on
                local priorities and existing relationships.</li>

            <li><b>Sustainable Public Services</b> - Work with
                the Wales Governance Centre, the Office for
                Budget Responsibility and others to understand
                devolved public finances and the future needs
                of Welsh public services. We will look for new
                ways to address any future funding gaps,
                grow our tax base and consider the funding
                implications of any recommendations from the
                Constitutional Commission.</li>

            <li><b>Supply Teaching and Looked After Children</b> - We believe these two vital services should
                not be run for private profit. We will work
                with partners to develop options for a more
                sustainable model of supply teaching with
                fair work at its heart, which will include local
                authority-led and school-led alternatives and put
                in place a framework to remove profit from the
                care of looked after children.
            </li>

            <li><b>School Term Dates</b> - Aim to reform school term
                dates to bring them more in line with patterns of
                family life and employment. We will also explore
                options to reform the rhythm of the school day to
                create space for more wide-ranging, culturally accessible activities and opportunities</li>

            <li><b>Reforming Qualifications</b> - Focus on
                experiences and wellbeing as we reform
                qualifications, in line with Wales' new curriculum.
                We will significantly expand the range of made in-Wales vocational qualifications to fit the needs
                of our learners and our economy.</li>

            <li><b>Tertiary Education and Research Bill</b> - Take forward this Bill to empower education
                providers to be part of a diverse, agile and
                collaborative sector that delivers for learners,
                employers and communities. We will jointly
                develop a new mission-based national
                innovation strategy to be implemented across
                government and by the Commission for Tertiary
                Education and Research, which has a leading
                role in promoting innovation in Wales. We will
                also work together on post-16 curriculum
                reforms informed by our new national curriculum,
                an expansion in lifelong learning and workforce
                professional development.</li>
