        <h1>Policy Programme</h1>
        <h2>Radical Action in Testing Times</h2>

        <p>The challenges we face in the aftermath of the pandemic call for
            radical action, which will improve the lives of everyone in Wales.</p>

        <p>From school children going hungry to parents juggling the costs of childcare and access to early years
            education. From rising household bills and a housing crisis affecting every generation to older people
            worried about whether they can afford care in their later years, this agreement will support people
            throughout their lives, during the most testing of times.</p>

        <p>The Welsh Government and <span lang="cy">Plaid Cymru</span> will be ambitious in the action we take together
            to
            address
            these issues.</p>

        <h3>Working Together, We Will: </h3>

        <ul>

            <li><b>Free School Meals</b> - Extend free school meals
                to all primary school pupils, over the lifetime of
                this agreement, as a further step to reaching
                our shared ambition that no child should go
                hungry. We agree that universal free school
                meals will be a transformational intervention
                in terms of child hunger and child poverty,
                which will support educational attainment and
                child nutrition and local food production and
                distribution, benefiting local economies.
            </li>

            <li><b>Childcare</b> - Expand free childcare to all two year-olds with a particular focus on providing
                and strengthening Welsh-medium childcare. </li>

            <li><b>Future of Social Care</b> - Set up an expert group
                to support our shared ambition to create a
                National Care Service, free at the point of need,
                continuing as a public service. We will agree an
                implementation plan by the end of 2023. We will
                continue to better integrate health and care and
                work towards parity of recognition and reward
                for health and care workers.</li>


            <li><b>Second Homes</b> - Take immediate and radical
                action to address the proliferation of second
                homes and unaffordable housing, using the
                planning, property and taxation systems.
                Actions being planned include a cap on the
                number of second and holiday homes; measures
                to bring more homes into common ownership;
                a statutory licensing scheme for holiday lets;
                greater powers for local authorities to charge
                council tax premiums and increasing taxes on
                second homes. We will explore local authority
                mortgages.</li>

            <li><b>National Construction Company</b> - Establish
                <span lang="cy">Unnos</span>, a national construction company,
                to support councils and social landlords to
                improve the supply of social and affordable
                housing.
            </li>

            <li><b>Building Safety</b> - Significantly reform the current
                system of building safety, which has allowed
                a culture of cutting corners to the detriment of
                public safety. We will introduce a second phase
                of the Welsh Building Safety Fund.</li>

            <li><b>Property and Fair Rents</b> - Publish a White
                Paper to include proposals for a right to
                adequate housing, the role a system of fair rents
                (rent control) could have in making the private
                rental market affordable for local people on local
                incomes and new approaches to making homes
                affordable.</li>

            <li><b>Homelessness</b> - End homelessness. If people
                are made homeless it should be brief, rare and
                unrepeated. We will reform housing law, enact
                the Renting Homes Act to give renters greater
                security and implement the Homeless Action
                Group recommendations.</li>

            <li><b>Council Tax Reform</b> - Reform one of
                the most regressive forms of taxation -
                which disproportionately impacts poorer
                areas of Wales - to make it fairer</li>

            <li><b>Procurement</b> - Explore how to set meaningful
                targets to increase Welsh public sector
                procurement from the current 52%. As a first
                step, we will carry out a detailed analysis of
                the public sector supply chains and promote
                the purchasing of made-in-Wales products and
                services.</li>

            <li><b>Local Tourism Levies</b> - Introduce local tourism
                levies using local government finance reform
                legislation.</li>
