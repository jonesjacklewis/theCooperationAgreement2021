        <h1>A Greener Wales to Tackle
            Climate Change and the
            Nature Emergency
        </h1>

        <p>The climate and nature emergency are the greatest threats facing our
            world. If we do not act now, our children and grandchildren will inherit
            a more polluted, more unstable and more dangerous planet.</p>

        <p>By working together to tackle these twin emergencies, we will take bold steps towards a net zero Wales.
            We will address nature loss, improve biodiversity and plant more trees. As our climate changes, too many
            people have woken to find their homes flooded and they fear when the next storm will hit. We will learn
            from past flooding events and invest in flood defences to protect communities.</p>

        <p>We will also start the process of reforming farm support to help family farms and agricultural businesses
            become greener and more sustainable.</p>

        <h2>Working Together, We Will: </h2>

        <ul>


            <li><b>Net Zero</b> - Commission independent advice
                to examine potential pathways to net zero by
                2035 - the current target date is 2050. This
                will look at the impact on society and sectors
                of our economy and how any adverse effects
                may be mitigated, including how the costs and
                benefits are shared fairly. We support devolution
                of further powers and resources Wales needs
                to respond most effectively to reach net zero,
                specifically the management of the Crown
                Estate and its assets in Wales. </li>

            <li><b>Net Zero Energy Company</b> - Work towards the
                creation of <span lang="cy">Ynni Cymru</span>, a publicly-owned energy
                company for Wales, over the next two years, to
                expand community-owned renewable energy
                generation. </li>

            <li><b>Public Transport</b> - Ask Transport for Wales
                (TfW) to explore the development of transport
                links between North and South Wales, including
                how to protect potential travel corridors on the
                west coast of Wales. We will continue to press
                ahead with Metro developments to improve
                connectivity and encourage people to switch
                to public transport. We will ask TfW to work
                with local authorities in North West Wales and
                the Welsh Government to develop plans for an
                integrated transport system.
            </li>

            <li><b>Biodiversity</b> - Agree that targets and an
                environmental governance body have a
                role to play in helping to protect and restore
                biodiversity for species and habitats in our
                terrestrial and marine environments.</li>

            <li><b>Tree Planting</b> - Work with the farming
                community to encourage woodland creation on
                less productive land and through agro-forestry.
                This will include support for active landowners
                and farmers through the sustainable farming
                scheme. We will explore ways of drawing
                investment for woodland creation that secures
                local ownership and control.</li>

            <li><b>Agricultural Pollution</b> - We will work with the
                farming community to improve water quality
                and air quality, deploying the Water Resources
                Regulations 2021, taking an approach targeted
                at those activities known to cause pollution. </li>

            <li><b>Flood Review</b> - Commission an independent
                review of the local government section 19 and
                Natural Resources Wales reports into extreme
                flooding in winter 2020-21 and act on its
                recommendations</li>

            <li><b>Flood Capital Investment and National Resilience</b> - Invest more in flood management
                and mitigation and plan to respond to the
                increased risk of flooding. We will ask the
                National Infrastructure Commission for Wales to
                assess how the nationwide likelihood of flooding
                of homes, businesses and infrastructure can be
                minimised by 2050.</li>

            <li><b>Sustainable Farming Scheme</b> - Introduce a
                transition period as we reform the system of farm
                payments so stability payments will continue to
                be a feature of the Sustainable Farming Scheme
                during and beyond this <span lang="cy">Senedd</span> term. We will
                agree the longer-term arrangements for Welsh
                agriculture, recognising the particular needs of
                family farms and acknowledging ecologically
                sustainable local food production. </li>

            <li><b>community Food Strategy</b> - Develop a
                community food strategy to encourage the
                production and supply of locally-sourced food
                in Wales.</li>
